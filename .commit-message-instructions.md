## Goal

- Generate Conventional Commits from #changes for this NestJS backend.

### Input

- Use only #changes (staged diff summary or bullets). Do not invent details.

### Output

- Plain text only (no code fences/markdown). One commit message per run.
- Format: type(scope): subject
    - subject ≤ 72 chars, imperative mood, no trailing period.
- Optional body: brief paragraphs or bullets (~72 wrap) explaining why + key changes.
- Optional footer lines:
    - BREAKING CHANGE: … (required for breaking updates; may also use type(scope)!: …)
    - Issue refs: Closes #123, Fixes #456, Refs #789
- Multi-scope allowed: type(scope1,scope2): subject

### Types

- feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert

Scopes (backend)

- auth, users, orders, quotes, payments, schema, db, config, logger, swagger, webhooks, mailer, storage, api, backend

### Style rules

- Prefer refactor for non-behavior changes; chore for tooling/config/deps.
- Use specific scopes (feature/module/layer). Fallback to api or backend.
- Do not list filenames or diffs; summarize intent and effects.
- If #changes includes removals/renames/contract changes, add a BREAKING CHANGE footer with migration notes.
- Keep body focused on why and notable implementation decisions (e.g., Zod DTOs, Drizzle migrations, HttpExceptionFilter behavior, interceptors).

Note we use @commitlint/config-conventional here are the rules:

## Rules

### Problems

The following rules are considered problems for `@commitlint/config-conventional` and will yield a non-zero exit code when not met.

Consult [Rules reference](https://commitlint.js.org/reference/rules) for a list of available rules.

#### type-enum

- **condition**: `type` is found in value
- **rule**: `always`
- **level**: `error`
- **value**

echo "fix(SCOPE): Some message" # fails
echo "fix(SCOPE): Some Message" # fails

echo "fix(scope): some Message" # passes
```

#### subject-empty

- **condition**: `subject` is empty
- **rule**: `never`
- **level**: `error`

```sh
echo "fix:" # fails
echo "fix: some message" # passes
```

#### subject-full-stop

- **condition**: `subject` ends with `value`
- **rule**: `never`
- **level**: `error`
- **value**

```
'.'
```

```sh
echo "fix: some message." # fails
echo "fix: some message" # passes
```

#### header-max-length

- **condition**: `header` has `value` or less characters
- **rule**: `always`
- **level**: `error`
- **value**

```
100
```

```sh
echo "fix: some message that is way too long and breaks the line max-length by several characters" # fails
echo "fix: some message" # passes
```

#### footer-leading-blank

- **condition**: `footer` should have a leading blank line
- **rule**: `always`
- **level**: `warning`

```sh
echo "fix: some message
BREAKING CHANGE: It will be significant" # warning

echo "fix: some message

BREAKING CHANGE: It will be significant" # passes
```

#### footer-max-line-length

- **condition**: `footer` each line has `value` or less characters
- **rule**: `always`
- **level**: `error`
- **value**

```
100
```

```sh
echo "fix: some message

BREAKING CHANGE: footer with multiple lines
has a message that is way too long and will break the line rule 'line-max-length' by several characters" # fails

echo "fix: some message

BREAKING CHANGE: footer with multiple lines
but still no line is too long" # passes
```

#### body-leading-blank

- **condition**: `body` should have a leading blank line
- **rule**: `always`
- **level**: `warning`

```sh

## Examples

refactor(api): standardize API response envelope and clean DTOs

- standardize API envelope to { success, message, data }
- fix Zod validation serialization by reordering interceptors
- remove service response wrappers; return plain entities
- update auth DTOs and createApiResponseDto helper
- consolidate duplicate decorators/DTOs; clean imports
- add missing user-addresses module; fix strict TS types
- update tests and configs; remove PaginatedServiceResponse

BREAKING CHANGE: Responses now use { success, message, data } envelope; service methods return plain entities. Removed PaginatedServiceResponse and
ServiceResponse.

Fixes #123
